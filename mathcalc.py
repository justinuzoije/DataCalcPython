	For bestof = 3, this function gives an approximation for the expected number of games to reach the next rank in best-of-three.
	This approximation assumes that any match takes 2.5 games.

	To determine this, this function creates a matrix to represent the system of equations of the form Ax=b
	Let x[n] represent the expected number of games to hit the next rank from state n
	For non-endpoint states n, it holds that x[n] = winrate * {1 + x[n+steps_gained_with_win]) + lossrate * (1 + x[n-steps_lost_with_loss])
	This implies that x[n] - winrate * x[n+steps_gained_with_win] - lossrate * x[n-steps_lost_with_loss] = 1
	A matrix is created with these numbers, making appropriate adjustments for endpoint states, then solved

	Parameters -
		game_win_prob: Probability to win any game
